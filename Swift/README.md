# A Generic Decision Tree Classifier in swift
 
 ## The .playground file is an xcode playground that has the implementation and runs first on a sample string dataset and then on the iris dataset(which is comprised of Double type values). 
 
 ### If you cannot or would not like to use the playground, use the JustTheCode folder to inspect the code.
