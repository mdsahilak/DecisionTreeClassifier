# Just the code used in the playground.
## This directory is intended for people who would not like to download the playground file or do not use xcode playgrounds but would like to look at the code.
### This is not intended to run. It is just for inspecting code right on github. As of now github does not allow you to view a .playground file's source. The main run script is in the main.swift file and the others include the dataset, helper funcs, etc.
